# TwitterTopicAnalyzer
This script uses the tweepy library to search for tweets containing the specified keyword or hashtag, and then uses the nltk.sentiment.vader module to analyze the sentiment of each tweet. The SentimentIntensityAnalyzer class takes the text of a tweet as input and outputs a dictionary containing the sentiment scores for that tweet.

The script then aggregates the results to calculate the overall sentiment score for the given keyword or hashtag, and displays the results to the user in the form of percentages for positive, neutral, and negative sentiment.
